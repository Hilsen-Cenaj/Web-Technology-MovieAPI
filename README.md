# Web-Technology-MovieAPI
This project has been made for the course *Web Technologies* offered by the *Athens University of Economics and Business* at the spring semester of 2020.
We used **Spring Boot Framework** ,**Tomcat** server and **MySql**.
The API in which we take the description of movies/series is **OMBD API** ( http://www.omdbapi.com/ )
The user can *create new account* and then *log in*. Then the user can *save* the movie that he/she likes ,*delete* it or *edit* it.
